I meditate upon Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of BrahmƒÅjƒ´, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.",SB 1.1.1

Through these books I am able to get far more than a moment of association with all of these sadhus. It also reminded me of the verse in Bhakti Rasamrta Sindhu, sruti smrti puranadi..., because this Krishna Consciousness movement is justified by all shastra. This made me feel really grateful for Bhaktivinod Thakur and all the Vaisnava Acharyas, as it is only by their mercy that I have any hope and to make any substantial progress I have to take complete shelter of their instructions and follow it with enthusiasm. The Vaisnavas have taken so much effort to make shastra accessible to me, so there are no excuses. Krishna has made it easy, acharyas have made it more easy, but sometimes I feel like I forget about this and I start taking shastra for granted, as if it isnt a big deal that I have such easy access to Srimad Bhagavatam .

6/21/2020 18:13:15,Apramay,Reflection,"Hare Krishna Maharaj, 

When you mentioned how people get depressed or intoxicated in this world...using the material body as a basis. It brought a conversation I had about frame of reference. Ever since I have been introduced to the Vedic World - material universe and spiritual universe - atleast in hindsight - I feel like my mind has been constantly toggling the frame of reference spectrum between |Everything is Krsna's & I am this body| to suit the most convenient path to well... I guess more chewing the chewed - carvita-carva·πáƒÅnƒÅm.

Thankfully as much as my senses want to wander off into the world, my status as a minor doesn't allow me to run off and get lost. Having Srila Prabhupada's books and more specifically the association of all of the ISV devotees is like a leash tied to my neck that forcibily drags me back to chanting and reading. Ex: As much of a hole I dig myself into in the week; somehow or the other I end up in a Sunday Feast program that lifts me back out...Listening to Srila Prabhupada's point about being a dog in service to the Vaisnava's and Lord Krsna realises how ungrateful I've been even when I have gotten the best of the oppurtunities.

I was thinking about the analogy of smoke and fire and it relationship to Bhakti. Pure devotional service is like fire and it is all about service. however sometimes there is some disturbance in bhakti that isn't completely pure, and those impurities, such as the desire for mukti, are like smoke. However, as we feed the fire more and more through Chanting Krishnas names, Srimad Bhagavatam, and the instructions of the acharyas, the smoke gradually becomes more and more insignificant (pureha bhuman bahavo pi yoginas...). 
Krishna really takes care of you. All I have to do is stay alive in Krishna Consciousness (tat te nukampam....) and make a sincere endeavor.
Bhakti is such a perfect process in any situation. Unlike other processes it doesn't require any qualifications. Devotional service itself is enough to get over the pangs of material misery and desires that drive me away from krishna (badhyamano pi mad bhakto...).

We know that we should manage our anger (krodha) and let go of it as it is one of the Anarthas. However it‚Äôs becomes quite difficult to control one‚Äôs anger when the other person (especially an adult) is not following our advice as we feel that we are trying to help this person to correct his/her behavior.

So the scientist thought that by study of chemistry we can understand biology and hence life.  And then the chemist said, that everything in chemicals is about molecules and atoms.

Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj, my obeisances! You mentioned that hearing about Krishna's pastimes is the basis of establishing our eternal relationship with Krishna, especially in Vraja. Does hearing particular types of pastimes, I mean Krishna's pastimes in a particular relationship, establish or reveal our relationship with Krishna in that particular type of relationship? 

I was curious to know because most of Krishna's pastimes related his devotees in their human form, not in the santa rasa form such as his flute, paraphernalia, etc. Since not much information is available about devotees in the santa rasa as much as his servants, friends, parents, and gopis, how does a practicing sadhaka get to establish his relationship in the santa rasa compared to relationships in other rasa types? Seems like our desire to have a relationship with Krishna in a particular rasa comes into the equation after extensive hearing of pastimes. ",

8/1/2020 9:27:13,Vaikuntha-nayaka Dasa,Question,"Dandavats Maharaja.  This thought occurred to me, when you spoke about taking Darshan of the Deities in Vrindavan.

We hear the lila where an old woman, climbed up on Mahaprabhu's shoulders to take darshan of Deities.  And Mahaprabhu appreciated her enthusiasm

While Mahaprabhu Himself, would stand next to Garuda Stambha, in the mood that the Lord would perhaps see Him, when He sees Garuda.  Similarly HH Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati, I heard would not even wear his glasses while taking Darshan.  His mood was that more than he seeing the Lord, the Lord should see him.

So while taking Darshan, what should we emulate?  The enthusiasm of the old woman, or the self effacing moof of Mahaprabhu/Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati?",Your comment on taking Darsah

Later they all became his devotees.,
