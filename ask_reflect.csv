6/14/2020 11:18:53,Ramdasa,Reflection,"O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.",SB 1.1.1

It reminded me of the tulayama lavenapi verse from Srimad Bhagavatam, which describes how even a moments association with a bhagavata devotee of the lord cannot be compared to birth in the heavenly planets and even liberation. Through these books I am able to get far more than a moment of association with all of these sadhus. It also reminded me of the verse in Bhakti Rasamrta Sindhu, sruti smrti puranadi..., because this Krishna Consciousness movement is justified by all shastra. This made me feel really grateful for Bhaktivinod Thakur and all the Vaisnava Acharyas, as it is only by their mercy that I have any hope and to make any substantial progress I have to take complete shelter of their instructions and follow it with enthusiasm. The Vaisnavas have taken so much effort to make shastra accessible to me, so there are no excuses. Krishna has made it easy, acharyas have made it more easy, but sometimes I feel like I forget about this and I start taking shastra for granted, as if it isnt a big deal that I have such easy access to Srimad Bhagavatam .

The word ajñāna means “ignorance” or “darkness.” If all the lights in this room immediately went out, we would not be able to tell where we or others are sitting. Everything would become confused. Similarly, we are all in darkness in this material world, which is a world of tamas. Tamas or timira means “darkness.” This material world is dark, and therefore it needs sunlight or moonlight for illumination. However, there is another world, a spiritual world, that is beyond this darkness. That world is described by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the Bhagavad-gītā [15.6]",SSR

Therefore due to ignorance there is infection, and we suffer from disease. A criminal may say, “I did not know the law,” but he will not be excused if he commits a crime. Ignorance is no excuse. Similarly, a child, not knowing that fire will burn, will touch the fire. The fire does not think, “This is a child, and he does not know I will burn.” No, there is no excuse. Just as there are state laws, there are also stringent laws of nature, and these laws will act despite our ignorance of them. If we do something wrong out of ignorance, we must suffer. This is the law. Whether the law is a state law or a law of nature, we risk suffering if we break it.",SSR

6/21/2020 18:13:15,Apramay,Reflection,"Hare Krishna Maharaj, 

When you mentioned how people get depressed or intoxicated in this world...using the material body as a basis. It brought a conversation I had about frame of reference. Ever since I have been introduced to the Vedic World - material universe and spiritual universe - atleast in hindsight - I feel like my mind has been constantly toggling the frame of reference spectrum between |Everything is Krsna's & I am this body| to suit the most convenient path to well... I guess more chewing the chewed - carvita-carvaṇānām.

Thankfully as much as my senses want to wander off into the world, my status as a minor doesn't allow me to run off and get lost. Having Srila Prabhupada's books and more specifically the association of all of the ISV devotees is like a leash tied to my neck that forcibily drags me back to chanting and reading. Ex: As much of a hole I dig myself into in the week; somehow or the other I end up in a Sunday Feast program that lifts me back out...Listening to Srila Prabhupada's point about being a dog in service to the Vaisnava's and Lord Krsna realises how ungrateful I've been even when I have gotten the best of the oppurtunities.

Translation
The Lord advised him, “Go to Vṛndāvana and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra constantly.”

Purport
This is a solution to all sinful activities. In this Age of Kali everyone is perplexed by so many inconveniences — social, political and religious — and naturally no one is happy. Due to the contamination of this age, everyone has a very short life. There are many fools and rascals who advise people to adopt this way of life or that way of life, but real liberation from life’s perplexities means preparation for the next life. Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati. One should be situated in his spiritual identity and return home, back to Godhead. The simplest method for this is recommended herein by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We should constantly chant the holy names of the Lord, the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. Following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is recommending this process all over the world. We are saying, “Chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, be freed from all the complexities of life, and realize Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

7/1/2020 19:45:20,Srivatsa,Reflection,"Hare Krishna Gurumaharaj! 
I was thinking about the analogy of smoke and fire and it relationship to Bhakti. Pure devotional service is like fire and it is all about service. however sometimes there is some disturbance in bhakti that isn't completely pure, and those impurities, such as the desire for mukti, are like smoke. However, as we feed the fire more and more through Chanting Krishnas names, Srimad Bhagavatam, and the instructions of the acharyas, the smoke gradually becomes more and more insignificant (pureha bhuman bahavo pi yoginas...). 
Krishna really takes care of you. All I have to do is stay alive in Krishna Consciousness (tat te nukampam....) and make a sincere endeavor.
Bhakti is such a perfect process in any situation. Unlike other processes it doesn't require any qualifications. Devotional service itself is enough to get over the pangs of material misery and desires that drive me away from krishna (badhyamano pi mad bhakto...).

Despite knowing that the Supreme Lord is the controller in this situation, we are thinking to be in control. How do we manage this conflict and draw the fine line between getting angry on someone to correct their behavior versus controlling them to impose your choice upon them? ",

So the scientist thought that by study of chemistry we can understand biology and hence life.  And then the chemist said, that everything in chemicals is about molecules and atoms.  And that only physics can help you understand.  And then then people studying pysics came up with the theory ""reality at the level of atoms is dependent on the observer (someone with life)"".

(Like feeling happy that Krishna as Lord Varaha first saved Bhumi Devi, then fought, or feeling devastation reading He felt the smell of His Own blood during that fight, or nearly wanting to shout to the demon “stop it now!”, then thinking “No, Krishna wants to enjoy the fight”, or feeling similarly to Krishna’s cowered friends nearly wanting to save Krishna from Kalyia, etc,).

Hare Krishna Guru Maharaj, my obeisances! You mentioned that hearing about Krishna's pastimes is the basis of establishing our eternal relationship with Krishna, especially in Vraja. Does hearing particular types of pastimes, I mean Krishna's pastimes in a particular relationship, establish or reveal our relationship with Krishna in that particular type of relationship? 

I was curious to know because most of Krishna's pastimes related his devotees in their human form, not in the santa rasa form such as his flute, paraphernalia, etc. Since not much information is available about devotees in the santa rasa as much as his servants, friends, parents, and gopis, how does a practicing sadhaka get to establish his relationship in the santa rasa compared to relationships in other rasa types? Seems like our desire to have a relationship with Krishna in a particular rasa comes into the equation after extensive hearing of pastimes. ",

We hear the lila where an old woman, climbed up on Mahaprabhu's shoulders to take darshan of Deities.  And Mahaprabhu appreciated her enthusiasm

While Mahaprabhu Himself, would stand next to Garuda Stambha, in the mood that the Lord would perhaps see Him, when He sees Garuda.  Similarly HH Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati, I heard would not even wear his glasses while taking Darshan.  His mood was that more than he seeing the Lord, the Lord should see him.
